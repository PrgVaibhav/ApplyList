    question: "What is ApplyList?",

      "ApplyList is a personal job application tracker that helps you keep track of every job you apply for all in one place. No more forgetting where you applied or what stage you’re at.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How does it work?",
    answer:
      "You simply log the jobs you’ve applied to by filling in details like company, role, date, and status. ApplyList organizes them for you, so you always know your progress at a glance.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Why should I use ApplyList instead of a spreadsheet?",
    answer:
      "Spreadsheets are generic and messy. ApplyList is designed specifically for job hunting with reminders, filters, progress tracking, and a clean interface that makes your job search stress free.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Do I have to update the status manually?",
    answer:
      "Yes for now, you’ll need to update the status (like Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected). But this gives you full control and ensures the tracker stays accurate.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Will ApplyList still be useful after I get a job?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You can keep your job history safe for the future and come back whenever you’re ready to start applying again everything will still be there.",
  },
